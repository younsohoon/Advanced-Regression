# Advanced-Regression

This directory contains regression analysis exploration, where we delve into the comparative study of three models: random forests, smoothing splines, and lasso regression, alongside the classic linear regression. Each model brings its strengths and challenges to the table, from the interpretability offered by smoothing splines and lasso regression to the predictive power of random forests. However, as we navigate through this analysis, we'll uncover nuances such as the interpretability trade-offs inherent in random forests, the sensitivity to outliers in smoothing splines, and the robustness of linear regression. By examining their performance across different datasets and scenarios, we aim to provide insights into the practical considerations of selecting the most suitable regression model for various analytical tasks.
